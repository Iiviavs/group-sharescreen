/**
 * Wires a <video>/<audio> element's audio through the shared Web Audio gain
 * graph (see audioGain.ts) instead of the element's own volume, so the dial
 * can go up to MAX_GAIN (300%) instead of being capped at 100%. Falls back
 * to the element's native volume/muted when the graph can't carry the audio,
 * so the element still behaves correctly, just capped at 100% in that case.
 *
 * The element is muted only while the graph is *actually running*, and that
 * distinction is the whole point. Muting it the moment a graph existed meant
 * a suspended AudioContext — which is how every browser starts one created
 * before the page has been clicked, see audioContext.ts — produced complete
 * silence out of a UI that looked entirely normal. Now the element carries
 * the audio until the graph can take over, and takes it back if the context
 * is suspended again later (an interruption on iOS, for instance).
